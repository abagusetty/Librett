# LibreTT - Tensor Transpose Library

LibreTT is a free Tensor Transpose Library for nVidia, AMD, and Intel GPU accelerators.

## About

LibreTT is a portable Tensor Transpose library that incorporates and superseds the original 
cuTT library, https://github.com/ap-hynninen/cutt, which is no longer supported due to tragic 
death of its author, Antti-Pekka Hynninen in a car accident. Enhancements include adding thread 
safety by Valeyev Lab at Virginia Tech, https://github.com/ValeevGroup/cutt, incorporating 
AMD GPU support by Dmitry Lyakh, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, https://github.com/DmitryLyakh/hipTT 
followed by implementation of warpsize 64 by Alessandro Fanfarillo, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 
and adding SYCL support by Argonne National Laboratory.

## Manual Compilation
`make cuda [tests=all]`

`make hip  [tests=all]`

`make sycl [groupsize=16 | groupsize=32] [tests=all]` 

The default mode `make cuda | hip | sycl` will compile portable tests only, i.e. tests 1, 2, and 3.

The option `tests=all` instructs the build process to compile all tests in librett_test.cpp.

CUDA: Use `make cuda tests=all` to build all tests or `make cuda` to build only portable tests.

HIP:  Use `make hip` to build only portable tests since non-portable tests 4 and 5 will fail for HIP platform.

SYCL: Use `make sycl` to build only portable tests. The `groupsize=16` is default for SYCL platform. 

The non-portable test 5 will fail with `make sycl groupsize=16 tests=all`. 

Use `make sycl groupsize=32 tests=all` to check that all tests pass.

## The outcome of manual build

* `bin/`     librett_test, librett_bench, example
* `build/`   temporary placeholder for object files
* `include/` librett.h
* `lib/`     librett.a

## CMake compilation:

Example of CUDA compilation: `cmake -H. -Bbuild -DENABLE_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=70`

Example of HIP compilation: `cmake -H. -Bbuild -DENABLE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=hipcc -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx908`

Example of SYCL compilation: `cmake -H. -Bbuild -DENABLE_SYCL=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx`

Testing options: `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` (default)

## Testing

`Manual build`: Execute `bin/librett_test` without arguments.  
`CMake build`: Execute `ctest`
